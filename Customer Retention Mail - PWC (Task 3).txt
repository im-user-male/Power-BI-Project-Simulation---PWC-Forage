Subject: Key Insights and Recommendations for Customer Retention

Dear Janet,
I hope this email finds you well. Based on my analysis of the Customer Retention dashboard, I’d like to share the following key findings and actionable recommendations:

Key Insights:
1. Contract Preferences:
A majority of customers (62%) are on month-to-month contracts, which may pose a higher churn risk.
2. Senior Citizen Engagement:
Senior citizens comprise 22.66% of the customer base but typically have shorter tenures, highlighting a need for engagement strategies.
3. Service Usage:
Fiber Optic is the most subscribed internet service, suggesting a potential for targeted marketing campaigns to this segment.
4. Payment Method Impact:
Customers using electronic checks exhibit a notably higher churn rate compared to other payment methods.

Recommendations:
1. Contract-Based Strategies:
Introduce incentives, such as discounts or loyalty points, to encourage customers to switch to longer-term contracts.
2. Senior Citizen Engagement:
Design tailored plans or discounts specifically for senior citizens to boost satisfaction and retention.
3. Service Promotions:
Launch targeted promotions for Fiber Optic users to further capitalize on its popularity.
4. Payment Method Improvements:
Investigate reasons behind higher churn rates among electronic check users and explore strategies to minimize this churn.

Please let me know if there are specific areas you’d like me to dive deeper into or if there’s anything further I can assist you with.

Best regards,
Satyam Kumar
