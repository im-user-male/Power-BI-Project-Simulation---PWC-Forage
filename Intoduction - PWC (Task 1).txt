Since this is a Power BI job simulation, I hope to get hands-on experience in creating dashboards and learning how to integrate them into one. Iâ€™m also looking forward to understanding how to work with data in Power BI, like transforming and cleaning it, instead of just focusing on making dashboards. I want to explore how Power BI can be used to analyze data and help in making better decisions.
